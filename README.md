### First Milestone Project ###

## Aim ##  
   
 The aim of this site is to build a _static_ (front-end only) website, with 4-5 pages, for **The Monkees**.  
 Using _Wireframes_ to responsively design the 
 site in _mobile-first_ design. We have been provided with some assets in the form of audio, video and images that the band would like to include and
 have also been asked to source some additional peices to fullfil the _UX_ we would like the visitors to experience.
 We have had an interview with the client that has expressed some _user stories_ to us, as well as some key features they 
 would like to include.  
 * Primary ordience is Fans and Potential Fans.
 * Other audiences are people wishing to book bands for events.
 * The would like the multi-media used, images, audio and video.
 * Ability to create a social media presence.
