# The Monkees Band Website #
### First Milestone Project ###
***
## Aim ##  
   
 The aim of this site is to build a _static_ (front-end only) website, with 4-5 pages, for **The Monkees**.  
 Using _Wireframes_ to responsively design the 
 site in _mobile-first_ design. We have been provided with some assets in the form of audio, video and images that the band would like to include and
 have also been asked to source some additional peices to fullfil the _UX_ we would like the visitors to experience.
 We have had an interview with the client that has expressed some _user stories_ to us, as well as some key features they 
 would like to include.  
 * Primary ordience is Fans and Potential Fans.
 * Other audiences are people wishing to book bands for events such as Weddings and Christmas Parties.
 * The would like the multi-media used, images, audio and video.
 * Ability to create a social media presence.

## UX ##  
 The User eXperience was fundamental to my design process, starting with a _Mobile First Design_
 platform I created _Wireframes_ (which are included in the Wireframes folder in the 
 [Github Repositary](UX/Wireframes).) and also some _User Stories_ based on the information 
 provided in the interview.
 
 1. As a Fan I want to watch any videos of the band.
 2. As a Fan I want to listen to some of their back catalogue of songs.
 3. As a Fan I want to see when they are next on Tour.
 4. As a Fan I want to keep up with the latest news and new material.
 5. As a Fan I want to follow them on Social Media.
 6. As a Potential Fan I want to listen to their music to see if I like them.
 7. As a Potential Fan I want to watch to watch a video and see if I want to see them live.
 8. As an Events Organiser I want to see a video and check their followings to see if I like their performance and book them.
 9. As an Events Organiser I want to contact the band and Check availability and prices by messaging.  
 
I have kept the site as Easily as possible so if Potential Fan is converted to Fan on a page they can carryout a Fan User story.
As this is not intended to be a back end site the modals are for show only at moment for experiencing the affect.
We created a site that has 5pages in total, with external link opened in a new window, so as to ensure our page never dissapears from the Browser.
Upon researching different existing bands websites, _inspiration_ for the background video on the homescreen, with a Signup Button for Newsletter came from
[Oasis](www.oasisinet.com) Band Site. Featuring a video and links to news and new material.

## Testing ##  

I tested my code, using various platforms;

1. Google Chrome developer tools, using the _responsive design mode_ to view over multiple screen sizes for UX design set out.
   1. I also tested the compatibility of the site live on Iphone, Sony Xperia(Android) tablet as well as laptop and monitor sizes.
   2. 
2.The Developer Tools did not reflect the real world experience on testing, so adjustments had to be made for the real world experience on devices.
