They were formed in Los Angeles in 1965 by Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider specifically for the American
					television series The Monkees, which aired from 1966 to 1968. The musical acting quartet was composed of Americans Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith, and Peter Tork; and the English actor and singer Davy Jones. The band's music was initially supervised
					by producer Don Kirshner, backed by the songwriting duo of Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart.

He was not actually a drummer and needed lessons even to be able to mime credibly, but eventually was taught
							how to play properly. By the time The Monkees went on tour in late 1966, Dolenz was competent enough to play the drums himself. Dolenz wrote a few of the band's self-penned songs, most prominent being "Randy Scouse Git" from the album Headquarters.
							He provided the lead vocals for such hits as "Last Train to Clarksville", "Take a Giant Step", and "I'm a Believer". Toward the end of the series' two-year run, Dolenz directed and co-wrote the show's final episode.
