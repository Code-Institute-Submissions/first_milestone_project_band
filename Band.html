					<image class="band-photo1" src="../assets/images-video-music/images/band.jpg" alt="The four band members" /> The Monkees are an American rock and pop band originally active between 1966 and 1971, with reunion albums and tours in the decades that followed. They were formed in Los Angeles in 1965 by Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider specifically for the American
					television series The Monkees, which aired from 1966 to 1968. The musical acting quartet was composed of Americans Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith, and Peter Tork; and the English actor and singer Davy Jones. The band's music was initially supervised
					by producer Don Kirshner, backed by the songwriting duo of Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart.

						<p>
							<image class="member-photo-md" src="../assets/images-video-music/images/md-old.jpg" alt="Micky Dolenz" /> In 1965, Dolenz was cast in the television sitcom The Monkees and became the drummer and a lead vocalist in the band created for the show. He was not actually a drummer and needed lessons even to be able to mime credibly, but eventually was taught
							how to play properly. By the time The Monkees went on tour in late 1966, Dolenz was competent enough to play the drums himself. Dolenz wrote a few of the band's self-penned songs, most prominent being "Randy Scouse Git" from the album Headquarters.
							He provided the lead vocals for such hits as "Last Train to Clarksville", "Take a Giant Step", and "I'm a Believer". Toward the end of the series' two-year run, Dolenz directed and co-wrote the show's final episode.

							<image class="member-photo-pt" src="../assets/images-video-music/images/pt.jpg" alt="Peter Tork" /> Tork was a proficient musician, and though the group was not allowed to play their own instruments on their first two albums, he was an exception, playing what he described as "third chair guitar" on Mike Nesmith's song, "Papa Gene's Blues," from
							their first album. He subsequently played keyboards, bass guitar, banjo, harpsichord, and other instruments on their recordings. He also co-wrote, along with Joey Richards, the closing theme song of the second season of The Monkees, "For Pete's
							Sake". On the television show, he was relegated to playing the "lovable dummy," a persona Tork had developed as a folk singer in New York's Greenwich Village.

							<image class="member-photo-mn" src="../assets/images-video-music/images/mn.jpg" alt="Mike Nesmith" /> From 1965 to early 1970, Nesmith was a member of the television pop-rock band The Monkees, created for the television situation comedy of the same name. According to his May 2015 interview on Gilbert Gottfried's podcast, someone showed him a copy
							of the famous press advertisement asking for "four insane boys" so he applied for the job. Nesmith won his role largely by appearing blasé when he auditioned. He rode his motorcycle to the audition, and wore a wool hat to keep his hair out of his
							eyes; producers Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider remembered "Wool Hat", and called Nesmith back. The Gretsch guitar company built a one-off, natural-finish, 12-string electric guitar for Nesmith when he was performing with The Monkees.

							<image class="member-photo-dj" src="../assets/images-video-music/images/dj.jpg" alt="Davy Jones" /> (30 December 1945 – 29 February 2012) From 1966 to 1971, Jones was a member of the Monkees, a pop-rock group formed expressly for a television show of the same name. With Screen Gems producing the series, Jones was shortlisted for auditions, as
							he was the only Monkee who was signed to a deal with the studio, but still had to meet producers Bob Rafelson's and Bert Schneider's standards. Jones sang lead vocals on many of the Monkees' recordings, including "I Wanna Be Free" and "Daydream
							Believer".Jones is the next closest member of the Monkees (to Micky Dolenz) who had worked with the band since its inception. The exceptions have been the new songs recorded in 1986 and since his death.
